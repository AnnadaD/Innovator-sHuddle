                <p>Growing up I was told that I am
                    someone a little ahead of my age
                    group. They said that I give good
                    advice and that I emit an ‘elder
                    sister’ energy. It didn’t occur to me
                    that I really wanted to become an
                    elder sister to people until the
                    pandemic hit and I could see how
                    unfavorably some people were
                    affected. Pandemic was also the
                    time where I somewhat ‘found
                    myself’ (it’s a process honestly)
                    and I realized I wanted to help
                    people, make them feel seen,
                    heard and understood. That is
                    
                    when I created ascenteen (uh-
                    sen-teen), the mental health and
                    
                    personality development venture.
                    We are a small group of people
                    trying to write blogs and create
                    some products to assist young
                    people into creating their own
                    beautiful life.

                <p>During the lockdown I had a lot of free
                    time and my brother gave me the idea to
                    take my love of baking and start a
                    business and I did it! I started Take a Bake
                    in July 2020 and haven’t looked back
                    since. I bake and sell different kinds of
                    brownies, cakes, muffins, cheesecakes and
                    pizookies.
                    Starting Take a Bake has been one of the
                    best decisions of my life. The satisfaction
                    you get from doing your own thing
                    independently and earning from it is
                    something else entirely. I’m extremely
                    grateful to my amazing customers and
                    family for supporting me on this journey.

                <p>You may have heard people
                    painting on canvas or papers
                    but ever heard about painting
                    on walls? So that's what I do!
                    yes you heard it right, i paint
                    walls and that's my venture;
                    which offers customized wall
                    painting services.
                    Being an artist for more than 15
                    years I never thought beyond
                    painting on paper but lockdown
                    changed the game for me
                    when I gave my first shot at wall
                    mural painting and from then
                    on there was nothing that could
                    stop me!
                    The venture is focused on providing
                    customized wall mural services(wall
                    paintings) for cafes, homes and various
                    corporate spaces. Wherein I paint
                    illustrations on walls according to the
                    client requirements, which mostly tries to
                    depict the purpose of existence of that
                    particular given space. Till date I have
                    completed 4-5 wall projects and I am
                    planning to hop on many more as the
                    venture progresses.
                    Do contact me for wall mural services.
